We give the raw results of our numerical experiments here. The models which are trained for a certain number of frames are evaluated 
for 20 times, and the average performance and the estimated standard deviation of the performance are recorded. 

In the files, each line represents a tuple of (number of episodes, avg performance, std of performance).
