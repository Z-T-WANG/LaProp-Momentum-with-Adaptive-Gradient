We give the raw results of the Rainbow experiments here. The models that are trained for a certain number of frames are evaluated 
for 20 times, and the average performance and the estimated standard deviation of the performances are recorded for each model.

In the files, each line represents a tuple of ```(number of episodes, avg performance, std of performance)```.
