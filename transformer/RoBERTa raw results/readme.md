The raw results of the RoBERTa pretraining are presented. The training settings are as described in ```readme.md``` in the parent directory. 
When we do not use a warmup schedule, a "no_warmup" keyword is added to the file name.

The tuples (raw training loss, perplexity, norm of the gradient) during training are recorded in the files.
